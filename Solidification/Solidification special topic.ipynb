    "Morphological stability is a concept, which is used to describe the solidification structure of a material. At a certain solidification velocity, shown in figure 1, the liquid diffusivity of alloying elements is not fast enough to make the concentration at the SLI uniform, and the planar SLI will develop dendritic structure. This is called the constitutional stability limit. \n",

    "If the dendrite tip radius is similar in magnitude to the dendrite length, the structure is called globular/cellular. As the solidification velocity increases, the solidification tip radius becomes more narrow, as microsegregation effects become stronger. This leads to a more pronounced columnar/equiaxed dendritic structure. \n",

    "Many models have been proposed for the prediction of the cell-to-dendrite transformation in solidification. Simple analytical relations with fitting constants produce results that deviate an order of magnitude of measurements and state-of-the-art phase-field models, when natural convection is ignored. So far, analytical solutions are unable to accurately describe the phenomenon, and fitting to experimental data is required. Numerical simulations show promising results, but are computationally limited to binary alloys as of now. Numerical modelling of pseudo-binary alloys should be carried out to see if the results are applicable to engineering materials."
